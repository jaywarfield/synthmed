# **SynthMed Agent - IBM AI Lab Challenge: AI Medical Research Synthesis Agent**

## Client Persona

A medical research team overwhelmed by the volume of scientific literature and seeking AI support for synthesis and citation.

## Challenge Statement

How might we use AI agents to help researchers synthesize insights from multiple medical papers and answer complex questions with citations?
Background Context

The AI agent ingests multiple documents and uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on relevant passages.

## Solution Requirements
- Multi-document ingestion and analysis.
- Citation of source material.
- Prompt engineering of synthesis.
- Backend integration of document processing.

## Suggested Technologies
- watsonx.ai Prompt Lab
- IBM Granite
- Flask or Streamlit

## Resources
- Sample research papers.
- Prompt engineering guides.
- Python libraries for PDF processing.

## Learning Outcomes
- Advanced prompt engineering.
- Code generation and optimization.
- RAG-based agent design.

## Optional Extensions (Advanced):
- Vector database integration.
- Table extraction and structured data synthesis.
