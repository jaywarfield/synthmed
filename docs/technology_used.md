# **SynthMed Agent - IBM AI Lab Challenge: AI Medical Research Synthesis Agent**

### Technology Used

The IBM AI Experiental Learning Lab with courses, coaches, and mentors has been a great live learning experience with the IBM AI platform and IBM Design Thinking.

With the SynthMed project we used:

1. IBM watsonx ai: 

Prompt Lab using Granite model to test prompts and determine which model would provide the best answers.

Agent Studio initially for coming up-to-speed on Agents.

Code Assistant plugin installed in Visual Studio to provide code snippets for potential use in Agent tools as well as to validate and tune the Agent tools. 

Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab to define the project.

2. IBM Orchestrate:

Using available models with llama.

Orchestrate UI and ADK to define agent yaml files,  import medical pdfs into agent knowledge bases, and define tools for use by agents.

Extensive experimentation to implement best descriptions and instructions of the main agent and each sub-agent to ensure repeatable and easily understandable responses, and using Thumbs Up/Down to train the agent on desired outcome.

Intelligent agents are embedded directly into a web application using the embedded chat features to create rich, interactive experiences.  Agents connect with users through channels to entry points like websites, Slack workspaces, or other message platforms.   With the web chat channel, the agent is embedded directly into a web page, enabling dynamic, interactive conversations that boost engagement and productivity.  You can customize the UI and behavior to match your brand and user needs, handle advanced events securely, and work with both draft and live agents for testing and production.

3. IBM Design Thinking:

Team Charter 

Research Plan

Empathy Map

As-Is Scenario Map

Needs Statement

To-Be Scenario Map.

Prototyping and reviewing outcomes.
